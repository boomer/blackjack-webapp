# Refactoring: 
# Hide first card for the dealer 1) need to show first card if dealer gets 21 after first deal, 
# 2) show all cards on dealer bust, 
# 3) show all dealer cards when game win/lose. 
# Only show dealer total for cards shown; i.e. don't include first card in total shown until after the hand concludes.
